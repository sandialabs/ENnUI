	abstract = {This standard contains the authoritative definition of the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84), which currently is the official NSG positional reference system. It defines the coordinate reference frame upon which all NSG coordinate systems (e.g. latitude/longitude/height; Military Grid Reference System) are based. It specifies the horizontal datum for all NSG mapping and charting, and provides parameters for transforming coordinates to other local horizontal datums. It provides precise coordinates of GPS tracking stations which form the basis of the WGS 84 coordinate reference frame. It defines the components of WGS 84, such as the ellipsoid (mathematical basis of coordinate systems); Earth Gravity Model (needed for elevation data, inertial navigation systems, etc.); and World Magnetic Model (needed for navigation and other applications). This document is an updated version of NIMA Technical Report 8350.2, Third Edition (4 July 1997).},

	abstract = {The vertical synthetic aperture radar (VSAR) is proposed as a navigation sensor, and a companion navigation algorithm – Trusted Inertial Terrain-Aided Navigation (TITAN) – is introduced. The TITAN algorithm consumes vector range-Doppler measurements produced by a VSAR and correlates them against a local digital terrain elevation map with an extended Kalman filter, enabling accurate navigation without the need for GPS. The navigation accuracy of the VSAR/TITAN combination is quantified with post-processed flight data, and shown to be within 15 meters.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1711.02508},
	abstract = {This article is an exhaustive revision of concepts and formulas related to quaternions and rotations in 3D space, and their proper use in estimation engines such as the error-state Kalman filter. The paper includes an in-depth study of the rotation group and its Lie structure, with formulations using both quaternions and rotation matrices. It makes special attention in the definition of rotation perturbations, derivatives and integrals. It provides numerous intuitions and geometrical interpretations to help the reader grasp the inner mechanisms of 3D rotation. The whole material is used to devise precise formulations for error-state Kalman filters suited for real applications using integration of signals from an inertial measurement unit (IMU).},
